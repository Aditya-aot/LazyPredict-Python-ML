# LazyPredict-Python-ML  ------

comparative analysis of multiple machine learning models for predicting automotive prices. The study evaluates the performance of various algorithms on a diverse dataset of vehicle characteristics and market prices. The dataset encompasses multiple features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and various other specifications that influence vehicle pricing.
Initially, the Lazy Predict library is utilized to rapidly evaluate a range of candidate models and identify the top performers. Subsequently, these selected models are implemented and fine-tuned individually.
